This program is for visualizing the hierarchical structure of natural cities using the radial layout. It is based on the following paper:

<i>Jiang B. (2016), A Topological Representation for Taking Cities as a Coherent Whole, Preprint: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1607/1607.07169.pdf"> https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1607/1607.07169.pdf </i>

<b>How to do:</b>

Just <i> drag and drop </i> the related .shp file into the input field, then click <i> Start </i>. The result will be automatically saved in the same directory with your data files. 

Having ArcGIS SDK .NET installed is a prerequisite to run the program. Currently, the tool is compatible with ArcGIS 10.0 and 10.2.

Note that, if more than 1000 nodes, it might take a while for generating the result. Normally it takes 20 minutes for 6000 nodes.
